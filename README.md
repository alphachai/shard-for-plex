# shard-for-plex
This is quite an old project of mine. 

Written over the course of a week or so as a class project back in university, this app was my attempt to make a better mousetrap as the official app at the time was utter garbage.

The basics of browsing the library work(ed) in 2016. I'm leaving this project up in case it helps any future developer interested in working with the PlexAPI.
